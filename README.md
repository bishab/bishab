<br>Nepal,
### Namaste! 🙏
I am Bishab Pokharel, a data science and machine learning enthusiast from Nepal. <br>
- 📚 Currently in third year of B.Tech in Lovely Professional University, India 
- 🔭 Currently working as a freelancer 
- 🌱 Learning everything I get to see what's new in this vast big world of Data Science
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on Machine Learning projects <i>(cause a single Decision Tree is not as accurate as the Random Forest is!)</i>

I like to play around with zillions of data, who else doesn't?

## A little more...
I have completed several projects on my early phase of coding esp. in C, C++, JAVA,R and PYTHON (which, as of now, have been an integral part of my life).

Now is the time to get hands dirty with incomplete, messy, millions long complex swirly datasets of people and things and turn those into some beautiful models that can do something out of the world!! <b> Isn't it interesting to predict the future? </b>

Come along with me! We will get to land somewhere in the future with our predictions, 
as Shakespeare says<br>
<i> Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.</i>
  
  <b> Let's build with ML!</b>

Regards,<br>
Bishab
